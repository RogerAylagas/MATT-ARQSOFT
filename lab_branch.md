# Laboratory Project
The laboratory project of the subject consists on analysing and designing a client-server software for playing chess.

## Analysis
First part of the analysis consists on extract features that the client wants the server to have and think about Use Cases which will deal with the client's requirements.

The list of User-Level Use Cases of the project can be seen [here](assets\docs\lab\Chess_UseCases_List_Roger_Aylagas.pdf)

Then the next step is developing those Use Cases and, if necessary, some sub-function Use Cases in order to better detail some steps of the User-Level Use Cases, specially the more complex ones.

The development of the Use Cases can be seen [here](assets\docs\lab\Chess_UseCases_Devel_Roger_Aylagas.pdf)

With the Use Cases of all levels developed, now it is time to design the conceptual classes diagram which will be the reference for the designer in order to know the main structure of the classes. This diagram can be ssen below.

It must be said that this result has been achieved by iterating many times and refining it to better achieve the requirements of the client.
