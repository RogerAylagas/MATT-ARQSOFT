# Main Project
The main project of the subject consists on analysing and designing a software for dealing with spreadsheets.

## Client Requirements
All information given by the client can be seen in [here](). In this document the client expresses some of the requirements and functionalities the program must have.

## Analysis
The information given by the client must be analyzed in order to extract the Use Cases of the software. From this analysis, a list of use cases can be extracted and will be the basis of the analysis. The list of User-Level Use Cases can be seen [here](assets\docs\project\Roger_Aylagas_SpreadSheet_UCList.pdf)

Then the next step is developing those Use Cases and, if necessary, some sub-function Use Cases in order to better detail some steps of the User-Level Use Cases, specially the more complex ones.

The development of the Use Cases can be seen [here](assets\docs\project\Roger_Aylagas_SpreadSheet_UCDevelopment.pdf)

With the Use Cases of all levels developed, now it is time to design the conceptual classes diagram which will be the reference for the designer in order to know the main structure of the classes. This diagram can be ssen below.

It must be said that this result has been achieved by iterating many times and refining it to better achieve the requirements of the client.
